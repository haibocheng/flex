<h3 class="head"><a name="Samples"></a>Flex Samples</h3>
<div class="indent">
	<p>The SDK samples directory contains source code for the Component Explorer sample application. The Component Explorer sample application provides basic examples for most of the MXML components available with the  Flex  framework.</p>
  <p>To compile the Component Explorer application:</p>
	<ul class="plain">
		<li class="plain">Windows: Run the build.bat file in the <em>Flex_Install_Dir</em>/sdks/<em>version</em>/samples/explorer directory.</li>
	    <li class="plain">Macintosh or Unix: Run the build.sh file in the <em>Flex_Install_Dir</em>/sdks/<em>version</em>/samples/explorer directory.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>After you compile the Component Explorer sample, open explorer.html in a web browser to view the application.</p>
	<p>You can download additional <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/flex3_sample_apps">Flex samples</a> from the Adobe Flex Developer Center.</p>
