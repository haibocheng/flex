To update our version of TLF do the following:

NOTE ***The signed rsl, textLayout_1.0.0.buildnum.swz should not be put in svn.***

1. From the TLF build, unzip openSource\textLayout.zip to 
   ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\projects\textLayout.

2. Check to see if there are any new files or removed files and update svn 
   accordingly.

3. From ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\projects\textLayout run ant to make sure sources
   build.  This must be done before step 4 which will replace the swc you just
   built with the version from the TLF build.

4. From the TLF build, copy textLayout\libs\textLayout.swc to 
   ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\libs

5. From the TLF build, copy the unsigned rsl, 
   textLayout\rsl\textLayout_1.0.0.buildnum.swf to ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\rsls

6. Add this rsl to svn.  Delete the previous version of the rsl from svn.

7. Edit ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\flex-config.xml and update the buildnum to match 
   the swf from the step above.

    <runtime-shared-library-path>
        <path-element>libs/textLayout.swc</path-element>
        <rsl-url>textLayout_1.0.0.547.swf</rsl-url>     <== update build number
        <policy-file-url></policy-file-url>
    </runtime-shared-library-path>

8. Edit ${FLEX_SDK}\frameworks\air-config.xml and do the same edit.

9. Commit all the changes.
