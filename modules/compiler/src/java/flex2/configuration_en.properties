help=For information on command line syntax and descriptions of configuration variables, specify a search string, or one of the following special keywords:\n\
\ \ \ syntax   - describe the general syntax of the command line\n\
\ \ \ list     - show a list of all basic configuration variables\n\
\ \ \ advanced - also match advanced configuration variables\n\
\ \ \ aliases  - sort using the short alias for the variable\n\
\ \ \ details  - always display the full details for each item\n\
Any other help keyword provided is used to match a full or partial configuration variable, alias, or text to search for in the description of the configuration variable.\n\
\n\
For example, '-help advanced aliases foo' would show all configuration options (both basic and advanced) containing the text 'foo', sorted by alias name.\n\
\n\
In the description of individual configuration variables, required values are marked with angle brackets, and optional values are marked with square brackets.  The notation [...] is used to indicate that the values are a list of arbitrary length.

link-report=Output a XML-formatted report of all definitions linked into the application.
load-config=load a file containing configuration options
load-externs=an XML file containing <def>, <pre>, and <ext> symbols to omit from linking when building a SWF

metadata.date=The creation date to store in the SWF metadata
metadata.description=The default description to store in the SWF metadata
metadata.language=The language to store in the SWF metadata (i.e. EN, FR)
metadata.localized-description=A localized RDF/XMP description to store in the SWF metadata
metadata.localized-title=A localized RDF/XMP title to store in the SWF metadata

Syntax=Usage: ${program} [configuration options] [default arguments]\n\n\
  Configuration options may be set on the command line as '-variable=value,value,value'. \
  (The number of values required depends on the particular variable.) Boolean options may be \
  enabled with '-variable=true' and disabled with '-variable=false', with '-variable' being \
  shorthand for '-variable=true'. Variables \
  may be cleared by setting '-variable=' with no value following the equals sign.\n\n\
  The default argument list is equivalent to setting the '${defaultVar}' variable. \
  The special string '--' may be used to terminate processing of named configuration options \
  and to force any remaining values on the command line to be interpreted as default arguments.\n\n\
  In general, a given variable may only be set once, but a few variables may be set multiple times \
  if noted as 'repeatable' in their description; i.e. '-a=x,y,z' may also be set as '-a=x -a=y -a=z' \
  if 'a' is repeatable. A more useful trait of repeatable variables is that by using the special \
  syntax '-variable+=value,value', the new values set will be appended to the current value, rather \
  than replacing the current value list.\n\n\
  Configuration variables sometimes have shortened aliases that make them easier to type. Hierarchical dotted \
  variable names will automatically have an alias generated for their 'leaf' name, if it is unique.\n\n\
  Filenames specified on the command line must either be an absolute path or relative to the current directory.\n\n\
  Use '${program} -help list' to list available configuration variables.

AdvancedSyntax=Usage: ${program} [configuration options] [default arguments]\n\n\
  Configuration options may be set on the command line as '-variable=value,value,value' \
  or '-variable value value'. (The number of values required depends on the particular variable.) \

  Configuration variables sometimes have shortened aliases to be easier to type. Hierarchical dotted \
  variable names will automatically have an alias generated for their 'leaf' name, if it is unique.\n\n\
  If a sequence formatted as $${token} is found in a configuration value, it will be expanded to the value of the token. \
  All Java properties are treated as tokens, but tokens may also be set using '+token=value' on the command line.  Token \
  replacement is limited to simple strings, but may be recursively defined.\n\n\
  Filenames specified on the command line must either be an absolute path or relative to the current directory.\n\n\
  Use '${program} -help list' to list available configuration variables.
